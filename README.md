#Eventmachine

EventMachine is an event-driven I/O and lightweight concurrency library for Ruby. It provides event-driven I/O using the Reactor pattern, much like JBoss Netty, Apache MINA, Python's Twisted, Node.js, libevent and libev.

EventMachine is designed to simultaneously meet two key needs:

Extremely high scalability, performance and stability for the most demanding production environments.
An API that eliminates the complexities of high-performance threaded network programming, allowing engineers to concentrate on their application logic.
This unique combination makes EventMachine a premier choice for designers of critical networked applications, including Web servers and proxies, email and IM production systems, authentication/authorization processors, and many more.

EventMachine has been around since the early 2000s and is a mature and battle-tested library.
